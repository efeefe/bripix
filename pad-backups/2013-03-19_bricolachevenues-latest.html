/><br
/>Dear Felipe,<br
/><br
/>I have listed here some information&nbsp; about the different possibilities regarding organizing the exhibition&nbsp; for Pixelache. Pictures of the different exhibition venues that can be&nbsp; found on Nathalie's Flickr at&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27126283@N07/sets/72157632568072327/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/27126283@N07/sets/72157632568072327/</a><br
/><br
/>Here are the different options for the exhibition venue at the moment:<br
/><br
/><b>Options in Suvilahti</b><br
/><br
/>Suvilahti&nbsp; is an old power plant area in the industrial district of Sörnäinen in&nbsp; Helsinki, where a lot of cultural and performing arts organizations and&nbsp; artists have their work studios. This is also where Pixelache offices&nbsp; are located and where we plan to hopefully have most of the festival&nbsp; programme (presentations, talks, workshops) in.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>I have attached some images of Suvilahti in this mail, more information and images can also be found here<br
/><a href="http://www.suvilahti.fi/front-page/">http://www.suvilahti.fi/front-page/</a><br
/><br
/><s>* There is a space that is currently empty on the ground floor of a building called <b>Puhdistamo </s></b><s>(one&nbsp; of the yellow buildings, the one next to the taller, circular yellow&nbsp; building). As you can see from the Flickr images of the space, it is&nbsp; quite big and a lot could be done with this space, for example with&nbsp; movable walls. We will have a meeting about this space with the people&nbsp; who manage it next week to find out what can be done in the space, if&nbsp; there are any restrictions about hanging works on the walls etc and get&nbsp; the exact measurements of the space.</s>not an option anymore, according to Nathalie<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>* Another space that is available and is located next to Puhdistamo, is called <b>Autotalli </b>('the&nbsp; garage'), at the moment is used as storage space. It's smaller and a&nbsp; very rough space and would need some walls to be built to hang things.<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>*Another option would be a rented <b>exhibition container</b> placed outdoors in Suvilahti.<br
/>These are the ones that we have been looking at:<br
/><a href="http://www.scandiccontainer.fi/index.php?page=naeyttelykontit&hl=en_US">http://www.scandiccontainer.fi/index.php?page=naeyttelykontit&amp;hl=en_US</a><br
/><br
/>We&nbsp; have a permission to use the area surrounding the buildings in&nbsp; Suvilahti for this purpose (the large asphalt area seen in the images of&nbsp; Suvilahti)<br
/><br
/>*<b>The Estonian Institute gallery space</b> (pictures&nbsp; labeled Viron instiuutti in the Flickr photostream)&nbsp; that is also&nbsp; located in Suvilahti. This space is about 100 m2, well lit and all works&nbsp; must be hung from the ceiling. If we were to organize the exhibition at&nbsp; the Estonian Institute, the exhibition would have to have a link with&nbsp; Estonia.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>And finally, a not so ideal exhibition space, because of its location outside of Suvilahti-Sörnäinen area :<br
/><br
/><b>Sorbus</b><br
/>A&nbsp; brand new gallery in the Kallio district in Helsinki. The gallery just&nbsp; opened last weekend, we are at the moment finding more about the space&nbsp; and its availability in May.<br
/>Some information can be found on their website at <a href="http://sorbusgalleria.tumblr.com/">http://sorbusgalleria.tumblr.com/</a><br
/><br
/>I&nbsp; hope this information helps in your planning of the exhibition, I will&nbsp; update you soon on the different venues and any new ideas we might come&nbsp; up with. Meanwhile, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have&nbsp; about the different options I have listed here!<br
/><br
/><br
/>Kind regards,<br
/>Ulla<br
