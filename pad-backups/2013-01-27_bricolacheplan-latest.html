><li>Is pixelache make a publication? No budget is dedicated to it. - Pixelache isn't planning to make any medium-sized publication for festival.. In recent years we have just made a small notebook which has details of events -Andrew</li
><li>How much is the budget for local decentralized events and tickets (what does that mean exactly?) - Local decentralised events made by Pixelache or ? -Andrew<br/><br

><b>Housing</b><br
/><ul><li>Helsinki: 2 rooms from residency housing to be allocated for bricos (Nathalie to confirm)</li
><li>Tapio can provide housing for 1-2 bricos some private apts from Kallio district of Helsinki possibly rented by Pixelache<br/><br

/><br
/><b>List here your view on the theme Facing North/ Facing South</b><br
/>The logic of north-south references,within geographical terms, tends to suggests a geopolitical understanding of space. It is such relation, attributed to a each specific observant that defines where north and south is. When we allow ourselves to seek a horizon line within the universe, where actually most of our the telecommunication infrastructure is navigating – to accept the freedom to circulate around these geographical references - we actually perform their disappearance.&nbsp; Within the bricolabs network, observing from various constellations, each observant perceives and performs subjectively within its own horizon, where left and right disappears and so does north and south.--&gt; Becoming a text here: <a href="http://piratepad.net/bricolachetext">http://piratepad.net/bricolachetext</a><br

/><br
/><br
/><b>INFO SENT by Nathalie to efeefe in December:</b><br
/><br
/><b>1/ Programme content &amp; formats</b><br
/><br
/>The overall theme of next year's festival being 'Facing North - Facing&nbsp; South', it will be important to discuss how the Bricolabs proposal will&nbsp; address this issue.<br
/>As global network with nodes both in the North and the South, there is certainly substance for this topic!<br
/><br
/>Another important aspect will be to<i> connect to the local community</i> here&nbsp; and in Tallinn. And that is something Pixelache can certainly help with.<br
/><br
/>In Tallinn, the programme will mostly consist of informal Camp&nbsp; Pixelache. For this we are planning to invite a keynote speaker (around&nbsp; main theme) and some plenary speakers (around sub-themes) and the rest&nbsp; is basically based on an unconference format, with an open call for&nbsp; presentations and possibly demos / workshops. Keynote and plenary&nbsp; speakers will be confirmed in the coming weeks. They have been chosen&nbsp; through a doodle poll that was open for the past month. You were one the&nbsp; candidates actually :) See here: <a href="http://www.doodle.com/hirku6e4wccudugh">http://www.doodle.com/hirku6e4wccudugh</a><br
/><br
/>A few sub-themes will help structure Camp Pixelache, that are being developed round the year through our Pixelversity programme:<br
/><a href="http://www.pixelache.ac/helsinki/pixelversity/programme-2013/">http://www.pixelache.ac/helsinki/pixelversity/programme-2013/</a><br
/><br
/>Since 'Waste/d' will definitely be a sub-theme, we actually would like&nbsp; to ask you, if you would be interested to be a plenary speaker and theme&nbsp; facilitator for Camp Pixelache?<br
/><br
/>So because we are planning a very informal programme in Tallinn, we are&nbsp; more expecting that the Bricolabs programme be for the Helsinki part,&nbsp; and perhaps the boat part, even though Bricolabs is also more than&nbsp; welcome to contribute to the Camp part. But for Helsinki, we have from&nbsp; the beginning been imagining some exhibition and seminar (but of course&nbsp; these can be done in many ways) and some workshops too.<br
/><br
/>In terms of workshop, there is already one that is planned (and it has&nbsp; its own budget) in collaboration with Usinettes (FR) and Enda &amp; Kër&nbsp; Thiossane (Senegal) around the fabrication of a plastic recycling&nbsp; machine and 3d printing with recycled plastic thread.<br
/><br
/><b>2/ The budget we can allocate to the programme bricolabs will be planning is 15000e.</b><br
/><br
/>The follow things need to be covered with this budget:<br
/>* travel &amp; accommodation costs and fees of programme planners, artists, speakers and other guests.<br
/>* possible rent of spaces (exhibition space, seminar space - but that&nbsp; depends some we can get for free), specific equipment rental (we also&nbsp; have some things, depends on what's needed), transportation of&nbsp; artworks/installations.<br
/><br
/>Pixelache provides from its own general budget / resources:<br
/>* production assistance (myself + Ulla Jaakkola)<br
/>* information &amp; communication resources (also printed matters like festival leaflet)<br
/>* some equipment that we have<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>3/ Communication between Bricolabs &amp; Pixelache</b><br
/><br
/>We understood that the planning of all this will happen through the&nbsp; bricolabs mailing list, which is an interesting experiment! It's&nbsp; important though to identify who is the main contact.<br
/>We presume you will be our main contact as you're the one who sent out the proposal?<br
/><br
/>Only Andrew Paterson from Pixelache is on the bricolabs list so far, more are planning to join to take part in the discussion. I am not sure if any other Pixelache members signed up yet.. I can ask next week when we have meeting 29.1. -Andrew<br
/><br
/>We figured that Tapio Mäkelä is a member of Bricolabs, so we might want&nbsp; to involve him a Helsinki node. Tapio has been involved in Pixelache&nbsp; earlier too!<br
/><br
/>I've taught a 1-week workshop at Pixelache in 2007, and do know Helsinki/Finland well, so maybe I can share some of that knowledge for folks going there... (who wrote that?)<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>5/ the Schedule</b><br
/><br
/>The festival is planned to take place on 16-19.5 in both Helsinki (16-17) and Tallinn (18-19)<br
/>Earlier during the festival week on 15.5, a Pixelversity online&nbsp; conference will be organised around the theme 'Knowledge &amp;&nbsp; Experience Sharing' - That might also be of interest to you!<br
/><br
/>Because some people will be coming from far away countries up to the&nbsp; North and need visas and so on, it would be good to have an idea of who&nbsp; will be the Bricolabs guests by January 15.<br
/>Let's discuss together the rest of the schedule when we skype.<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>6/ Festival venues</b><br
/><br
/>For the Helsinki part, we are planning to concentrate the events in an&nbsp; area called Suvilahti, where our office actually just moved 2 months&nbsp; ago.<br
/>Here you can see an aerial picture of the area (the part on the right of the pic)<br
/><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Suvilahti_plant_from_air.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Suvilahti_plant_from_air.jpg</a><br
/><br
/>I am also attaching another picture.<br
/><br
/>It's an old industrial area, from where it's rather quick to get to the city centre (with the metro 10min)<br
/>We are still figuring out different options for venues but here are a few details:<br
/><br
/>In the big outdoor open area, we could use exhibition containers (we have earlier used sponsored containers)<br
/>We also have a seminar/exhibition space reserved at the Estonian&nbsp; Institute which is also there, but there the works presented should be&nbsp; related to Estonia...In that place, there are also good spaces for&nbsp; smaller discussions<br
/>We are also looking at other exhibition/workshops spaces in Suvilahti but haven't got confirmation yet<br
/><br
/>In terms of seminar / discussion spaces, there are several options that we are currently trying to confirm.<br
/><br
/>On the ferry, there will the possibility to use a conference room.<br
/><br
/>For Estonia, we are actually not sure yet whether Camp Pixelache will&nbsp; take place in Tallinn or completely outside on an island called&nbsp; Naissaari (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naissaar)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naissaar)</a><br
/><br
/><br
/><b>INFO Sent from Nathalie to efeefe in January 2013:</b><br
/><br
/>As you maybe saw from the vote in our doodle poll (<a href="http://www.doodle.com/hirku6e4wccudugh)">http://www.doodle.com/hirku6e4wccudugh)</a>, there was a broad range of interest in keynote speakers, and we decided to make 3 direct invitation mails.<br
/><br
/>To Mary Mellor, Marcin Jakubowski &amp; Achille Mbembe,<br
/>As well as start a conversation with Escher Tsai about remote presentation or raising sponsorship for him to come.<br
