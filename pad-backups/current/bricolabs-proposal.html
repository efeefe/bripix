/><b>Project title</b><br
/>Bricolabs - multidirectional collaboration<br
/><br
/><b>Description</b><br
/><br
/>Bricolabs is a fluid network created in 2006 to investigate - from a critical and creative perspective - the loop of free/libre/open content, software and hardware for community applications. Bricolabs promotes open debate on such themes, between people with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise from Latin America, Europe, Asia and North America (so far). A number of collaborative initiatives emerged based upon Bricolabs' loose connections; others which already existed gained agency through its international ties. Some of its members are key articulators for initiatives such as Dyne.org, Rede MetaReciclagem, Internet of Things Council, House of Natural Fiber, Mdelibre, Access Space, Hackteria and others. Bricolabs was one of the networks gathered in Wintercamp (Amsterdam, 2009) and has given rise to lots of spontaneous meetings in other events.<br
/><br
/>The nonlinear history of Bricolabs, with its many spin-offs and adhoc cooperations, is a concrete example that collaborative projects can happen in a truly distributed fashion, with no need for a central authority moderating the flows of information.<br
/><br
/><b>Our proposal for Pixelache</b><br
/><br
/>1) Panels on multidirectional collaboration and free/libre/open technologies. Presentation of specific projects related to these themes. The selection of the projects to be presented will happen in the Bricolabs mailing list (integrated with the overall programme of Pixelache, and with an eye on budget and possible partnerships for funding travel expenses). The panels can take place both in Helsinki and Tallin.<br
/><br
/>2) Online happening: internet chat and cross-stream between Bricolabs members and groups in different parts of the world. Possible partners are Casa de Cultura Tainã in Campinas, Ubalab in Brazil; Southern Voices in Manchester UK, and plenty of other nodes related to bricolabs.<br
/><br
/>3) Public interventions/outreach (talks, performances, exhibitions, workshops) dealing with DIY/DIWO culture and technologies based upon free/libre/open circulation of information. Maybe doing something in the ferry between Tallin and Helsinki.<br
/><br
/>4) A meeting of the Bricolabs network, to further develop collaborative projects and exchange opportunities/knowledge/resources.<br

/><br
/>"Pixelache festival 2013 is entitled ‘Facing North – Facing South’ and&nbsp; is&nbsp; organized as a dual-city event, both in Helsinki and Tallinn&nbsp; during&nbsp;&nbsp; 16-19 May 2013. If every North as its South and every South its North,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is an invitation to alternately face North and South from multiple points of views."<br
/><br
/>"We&nbsp; are looking for organisations, groups or individuals who would like&nbsp; to&nbsp; organise a seminar and an exhibition for the Facing North – Facing&nbsp;&nbsp; South programme of Pixelache in Helsinki in 2013. We are hoping the&nbsp;&nbsp; Facing North – Facing South programme will bring interesting insights&nbsp;&nbsp; and points of views to the question of North-South relationships."<br

/><b>Drafts</b><br
/><br
/>Rise of decentralized communities, which enable forms of knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp; transference which is based on deterritorialization /Lab&nbsp;&nbsp; environments/virtual spaces for collaboration, do open a vast area of&nbsp; an&nbsp; almost ideological struggle, which dictate this necessity, thus of&nbsp; an&nbsp; irreversible need for open structures.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Collaborative&nbsp; environments where meetings are virtual and based on peer-to-peer&nbsp;&nbsp; connectivity are the only means to negotiate common frameworks on&nbsp;&nbsp; developing relations, projects and networked infrastructure.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><br
/>seeing&nbsp; Bricolabs as network infrastructure, the need to create/propose&nbsp; third-ways, when it comes to education,&nbsp; arises almost as an emergency,&nbsp; otherwise we are at risk of considering&nbsp; the paradoxical relationship&nbsp; between study and labor as normal .<br
/><br
/>In&nbsp; fact being a professional artist is one of the most blatant examples,&nbsp;&nbsp; whether the training is technical or academic most artists can’t easily find themselves a position, and that’s is simply art itself does not&nbsp;&nbsp; have a defined role in –productive- society, driving emergent artist to&nbsp; a&nbsp; practice that tends to reach benefits from cultural policies or&nbsp; simply&nbsp; must occupy the grey-areas in other fields –formal education-&nbsp; before&nbsp; succumbing to the creative industry.<br
/><br
/>Is&nbsp; not chance that informal education has become a more common practice&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to overcome such deficiencies, but is also true that possible&nbsp;&nbsp; gains in quality and relevance resulting from such programs loose their&nbsp;&nbsp; power due lack of validation and its subsequent non representativeness&nbsp;&nbsp; in the labor-market; there should be a revalidation of a transmission&nbsp; model&nbsp; based on non-profitable exchange of knowledge&nbsp; (after all this is&nbsp; the&nbsp; way we used to learn for ages before religious and capital&nbsp; restrictions).<br

/><i>"i agree...it seems timely to have a f2f...and if our previous&nbsp; discussions and musings stand true, imperative for the sustainability of&nbsp; the network</i><br
/><br
/><i>this year, and sorry to generalise, but i think it is people being&nbsp; in the mode of wanting to solidify their mission in preparation for the&nbsp; end of one age...</i><br
/><i>we (and many other networks) have not met&nbsp; much...and 2013 really gives a sense of some significant journeys back&nbsp; to meet and relay messages with a few interesting presents and stories&nbsp; no doubt and many long discussions into the next mornings!</i><br
/><br
/><i>i know how valuable it was for me and my sense of orientedness&nbsp; within the network and in the related works to be at wintercamp a few&nbsp; years ago. i know that communities are really needing our&nbsp; multidisciplinary approaches and hope that next year we all get back on&nbsp; the ground to develop the systems we were looking at, for distributed&nbsp; systems of co-creating, knowledge sharing, p2p education....and&nbsp; certainly there are several networks here in central america who are&nbsp; keen to engage with the bricos when they have dealt with the end of the&nbsp; world stuff in a few weeks!</i><br
/><br
/><i>so - i am not sure where i will be but am fully committed to being&nbsp; there in some way and really think it is not just needed for bricolandia&nbsp; but for the many nodes we represent and communicate with...."</i><br
