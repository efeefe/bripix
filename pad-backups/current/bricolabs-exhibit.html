><b>VENUE + STRUCTURE</b><br
/>We're likely getting a couple cargo containers (like these: <a href="http://www.scandiccontainer.fi/index.php?page=kaeytetyt-kontit&hl=fi_FI">http://www.scandiccontainer.fi/index.php?page=kaeytetyt-kontit&amp;hl=fi_FI</a> ) to host the exhibition. There should be wooden boxes (perhaps 30 or 40 like these: <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iV98rMIOrCs/UFqgQAe4v0I/AAAAAAAAGmE/HxRUF5yQdPs/s1600/Helsinki-Plant-tram1-2012.jpg">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iV98rMIOrCs/UFqgQAe4v0I/AAAAAAAAGmE/HxRUF5yQdPs/s1600/Helsinki-Plant-tram1-2012.jpg</a>&nbsp; ) available to define areas or other uses. We may be able to paint the&nbsp; boxes if we want to. And there is also a wall for graffitti: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hailten/3898065584/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/hailten/3898065584/</a><br
/><br
/>Bricolabs network is weaving a collaborative programme for Pixelache Helsinki 2013, "rooted in deep resonant networks where borders are seldom taken into account". The plans include a conference, maybe some workshops, a collective publication (or else an open process that might lead to that, eventually) and an <i>exhibition</i>.<br
/><br
/>To tell the truth, we are facing some issues in regards to the exhibition: whilst Bricolabs has a very concrete nature since its beginning, the very idea of transforming fluid processes into physical objects to be shown somewhere is felt as inappropriate by some.<br
/><br
/>In discussing such matters, we have decided to open a <b>call for brico-things</b>: objects that embody complex processes, becoming handles that open up the progress of ongoing projects. Examples of relevant contributions would be:<br
/><br
/><ul><li><b>Physical things</b>, to be sent or brought to Helsinki. Crafted objects, electronic devices, palo santo wood, working tools, installations... whatever represents brico for you. Proposal should include shipping costs, take into account customs procedures, define whether the thing should be sent back or else donated (and to whom). Could also be small things to be distributed to Pixelache participants like badges or stickers;</li
><li><b>Documentation</b> of past projects, current hypotheses or future concepts. From technical documentation to symbolic representations of your working processes, local context, results found or unsolved issues. Files must be prepared to be printed (vertical A4 document) in Helsinki or played on a screen (1-2 minute videos/audio);</li
><li><b>3D files</b> to be lasercut in local Fablab or in Refabspace (Sheffield) and then brought to Helsinki;</li
><li>Any other idea we may have.<br/><br
/></li></ul
>Insisting on networked e/affects, anyone interested could ask any other person in the world to submit whatever s/he believes is relevant for the bricolabs approach. The very conversation about things and processes could be incorporated in the exhibition.<br
/><br
/>Draft ideas will be accepted until the <b>first half of March 2013</b>. Bear in mind that the exhibition is supposed to open the 15th of May in Helsinki - time is short, we must be quick!<br
/><br
/>Please send us at least a title, short description of your contribution and a short statement of how it related to the bricolabs programme and the general theme of Pixelache (facing north/facing south). Proposals will be received via the <b>brico mailing list</b> or <b>private messages </b>to felipefonseca AT gmail. You can also post your proposal <b>anywhere on the web </b>and paste below a permanent URL.<br

><li>--- msst bamboo antenna --</li
><li>i'd&nbsp; like to send a bamboo antenna made in the first satelliteless movement&nbsp; meeting. it's 180cm long and 10cm wide. i checked with fedex and they&nbsp; charge 80 dollares for shiping from brazil. sending back is a lot more&nbsp; expensive, though - maybe there are cheaper carriers in finland?</li

/><br
/><s>Worth reading (from </s><a href="http://piratepad.net/bricolacheshort"><s>http://piratepad.net/bricolacheshort</s></a><s> ):&nbsp; Bricolabs proposes a critical perspective on the usual north/south&nbsp; dichotomy, interested and rooted in deep resonant networks where borders&nbsp; are seldom taken into account. This is as true for geographic&nbsp; boundaries as it is for disciplinary ones – recently Bricolabs members&nbsp; have turned their attention to anti-disciplinary collaboration as an&nbsp; escape from the common traps of western/northern paradigms of&nbsp; development.</s><br

/><s>An online symposium? Or just a one stop timezone scratching meeting... not sure if this should be inside the 'exhibit'...(Online symposium probably fits more into conference)</s><br
/><br
/><br

/><s>- proposal should include if you cover shipping cost&nbsp; and if not, what&nbsp; would it be? (tech raider :))</s><br
/><s>- will it pass through customs?</s><br

/><s>- does it need to be sent back, or can it be donated, if so, to whom?Are there new media institutions involved? could be donated to them?</s><br
/><s>Could it be an exhibition which the process is part of it?</s><br
/><s>&nbsp;Could be also something quite&nbsp; small that is distributed to Pixelache participants as part of the&nbsp; Pixelache event pack (like a badge or a sticker).</s><br
/><br
/><s>-Following our own bricomyths, any member can ask any another to sumbit what he/she believes could serve as an example of something that conceils the bricolabs approach (the idea is to have that sort of "conversation" between network participants around _things_ done, be them objects or not, that can be part of an exhibition). From the alcadie wheels from JPhilipe to the Palo Santo or the camembert smell.</s><br
/><br
/><s>Like the idea for the reader, can there also be coupled or connected objects/projects that are presented in a certain way to express shared basis of creation/production/code? Yes, yould be nice to tie this or the conversation proposed by jhon and jerneja that seems not many people have replied so far.</s><br

/><s>black boards with text from participants and info if happens workshops and where? could be plywood painted in dark-green..</s><br
/><br
