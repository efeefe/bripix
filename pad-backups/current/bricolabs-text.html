/><br
/><i>Bricolabs is an open network with members distributed worldwide. It is home for a number of innovative ideas and practices focused on free/open sharing of knowledge and information. Bricolabs is currently organising part of the Pixelache Helsinki 2013 programme.</i><br
/><br
/>North/south references may limit the understanding of the world in terms of conventional geopolitics. Such a perspective can lead to definitions about where north and south are in relation to a specific observing point. What if we allow ourselves to follow affective field lines instead? Most of our the telecommunication infrastructure is navigating simultaneously in multiple directions. Cultural identities are being constantly deconstructed. What used to be seen as north has its own south within, and vice-versa.<br
/><br
/>As a proposal for the 2013 edition of Pixelache Helsinki, we suggest that accepting the freedom to ignore borders is indeed a good way to effectively perform their disappearance. Bricolabs will engage its actors and participants into the philosophies of <i>deep resonant networking</i> and <i>anti-disciplinary collaboration</i>. We want to transmit and share an urgency for recognizing the work of artists, developers, thinkers - redefining geophysical and virtual&nbsp; ecologies of their practices, interventions, theories, researches as&nbsp; well as methodologies of a wide technological spectrum of open source models.<br
/><br
/>Among relevant resonant practices is the worldwide emergence of hackerspaces, experimental labs and other similar formations - spaces for the production and research of media art, open infrastructures, diybio, collaborative methodologies and plenty of other themes - but also places in which people with very diverse backgrounds can spend time together.<br
/><br

/><br
/>what lies on the boundary between north and south? is there a space in the middle?&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>1) Panels on&nbsp; multidirectional collaboration and free/libre/open technologies.&nbsp; Presentation of specific projects related to these themes. The selection&nbsp; of the projects to be presented will happen in the Bricolabs mailing&nbsp; list (integrated with the overall programme of Pixelache, and with an&nbsp; eye on budget and possible partnerships for funding travel expenses).&nbsp; The panels can take place both in Helsinki and Tallin.<br
/><br
/>2)&nbsp; Online happening: internet chat and cross-stream between Bricolabs&nbsp; members and groups in different parts of the world. Possible partners&nbsp; are Casa de Cultura Tainã in Campinas, Ubalab in Brazil; Southern Voices&nbsp; in Manchester UK, and plenty of other nodes related to bricolabs.<br
/><br
/>3)&nbsp; Public interventions/outreach (talks, performances, exhibitions,&nbsp; workshops) dealing with DIY/DIWO culture and technologies based upon&nbsp; free/libre/open circulation of information. Maybe doing something in the&nbsp; ferry between Tallin and Helsinki.<br
/><br
/>4) A meeting of the Bricolabs network, to further develop collaborative projects and exchange opportunities/knowledge/resources.<br
/><br
/><br
/>Rise of decentralized&nbsp; communities, which enable forms of knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp; transference which is&nbsp; based on deterritorialization /Lab&nbsp;&nbsp; environments/virtual spaces for&nbsp; collaboration, do open a vast area of&nbsp; an&nbsp; almost ideological struggle,&nbsp; which dictate this necessity, thus of&nbsp; an&nbsp; irreversible need for open&nbsp; structures.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Collaborative&nbsp;&nbsp; environments where meetings are virtual and based on peer-to-peer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connectivity are the only means to negotiate common frameworks on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developing relations, projects and networked infrastructure.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><br
/>seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; Bricolabs as network infrastructure, the need to create/propose&nbsp;&nbsp; third-ways, when it comes to education,&nbsp; arises almost as an emergency,&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise we are at risk of considering&nbsp; the paradoxical relationship&nbsp;&nbsp; between study and labor as normal .<br
/><br
/>In&nbsp;&nbsp; fact being a professional artist is one of the most blatant examples,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether the training is technical or academic most artists can’t easily&nbsp; find themselves a position, and that’s is simply art itself does not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have a defined role in –productive- society, driving emergent artist to&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; practice that tends to reach benefits from cultural policies or&nbsp;&nbsp; simply&nbsp; must occupy the grey-areas in other fields –formal education-&nbsp;&nbsp; before&nbsp; succumbing to the creative industry.<br
/><br
/>Is&nbsp;&nbsp; not chance that informal education has become a more common practice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to overcome such deficiencies, but is also true that possible&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gains in quality and relevance resulting from such programs loose&nbsp; their&nbsp;&nbsp; power due lack of validation and its subsequent non&nbsp; representativeness&nbsp;&nbsp; in the labor-market; there should be a revalidation&nbsp; of a transmission&nbsp; model&nbsp; based on non-profitable exchange of&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; (after all this is&nbsp; the&nbsp; way we used to learn for ages before&nbsp; religious and capital&nbsp; restrictions).<br
