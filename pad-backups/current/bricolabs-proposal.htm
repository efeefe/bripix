/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><b>CALL FOR PREXENTATIONS &amp; WORKSHOPS</b><br
/><b>DEADLINE: The call is open until 19.4&nbsp;</b><br
/><br
/>We are calling out for short presentations (5-15mins)&nbsp;<br
/>Our curated themes for the Festival are emerging as Creative Development (North-South, Tallinn-Helsinki&nbsp; &amp; other relations), Virtuality, Resonance, Anti-disciplinarity, Waste, Techno-ecologies, and Control. Welcome to be inspired by these or introduce other topics into the Camp!<br
/><br
/><b>Please note that for the workshops, apart from tables, limited electricity generated by solar cells and slow internet, Pixelache will not be able to provide other infrastructure or materials that would require to be carried from the mainland.&nbsp;</b><br
/><br
/><b>We would also like to stress that all&nbsp; presentations and workshops should try to adapt their form and materiality to the given locality, in an attempt to create a symbiosis between the camp and the island. Keep this in mind when you think along your contribution!</b><br
/><br
/>Presentations can still be proposed by confirmed participants until the Camp Pixelache day, but because of the infrastructure on Naissaar and the fact that there is a limited amount of places and spaces, we need to&nbsp; confirm all the participants, as well as workshops &amp; demos well in advance. The call is open until 19.4.<br

/>Workshop title: Are these berries mine? or Teaching the Commons<br
/>Workshop description (length, for whom, how many participants, prior knowledge required?) :&nbsp;<br
/>Participants would work together to develop a basic lesson plan / teaching resources used to present the concept of the "commons" to students (from primary school students through to adults).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>The problem: It can be difficult to explain the idea of the Commons and the associated rights and responsibilities to people. If done effectively,&nbsp; people who have learnt about the Commons should be much more responsible and confident about how they interact with Commons resources (cultural, environmental - eg folk music, water resources or wild berries).<br
/>This workshop could be made site specific: eg. how do we explain the commons in general and how do we explain the commons issues of Naissaar to users of the island?<br
/>For Whom: environmental and social workers, commons practitioners and educators (all disciplines)<br
/>No. of participants: OpenSpaceTech style workshop - who attends is the right audience<br
/>Length: 1-3 hours - This could be a long discussion.<br

/>Two alternative workshop proposals. Needed: some kind of sound amplification. Can be adapted to the unique circumstances of the event, though.<br
/><br
/>I.<br
/>Workshop title:&nbsp; Visual Beat Machines: Processing, Pd<br
/>Workshop description (length, for whom, how many participants, prior knowledge required?) :&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Even with no prior programming experience, learn to assemble your own simple music machines, with on-screen graphics and built-in sound, entirely free tools. We'll see how basic sound synthesis and envelopes work, and add sequencing for melody and rhythm. On the visual side, we'll cover how to draw simple geometry and images, then add input from the mouse, data on the Internet, sensors, or anything else you might like. The result: audiovisual toys you can use on your Mac, Windows, or Linux computer.<br
/><br
/>Participants: recommend max 15<br
/>Prior knowledge required: none, though any background in Pd or Processing may be useful<br
/>Supplies to bring: a laptop (and if desired, any hardware you might like to interface with)<br
/><br
/><br
/>II.&nbsp;<br
/>Workshop title: Making sound with the open source MeeBlip synthesizer<br
/>Workshop description (length, for whom, how many participants, prior knowledge required?) :&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><br
/>Make bass-lines, melodies, and sounds with a full-featured, open source hardware synthesizer, the MeeBlip. Learn simple modifications to the MeeBlip's onboard code for hacking the synth. Then experiment with novel inputs by building a ribbon controller and using an infrared sensor. For those of you with a musical background and a MIDI interface, we will also learn the basics of MIDI and sequencing by controlling the synth with Pd, the free visual creation environment. But for anyone, we'll have an introduction to the world of synthesis and sound through open technology.<br
/><br
/>Prior knowledge: No previous programming experience needed - just a desire to make some noise.<br
/>Supplies: Bring a laptop and, if you have one, a MIDI interface. Provided for participants - MeeBlip micro, inputs and materials for ribbon controller. Pure Data and MeeBlip toolchain work on Mac, Windows, and Linux; free.<br
/><br
/>(Cost depends on included parts, but basic expenses for parts should be around 60 €.)<br

/>Fun synth building workshop for everyone. During 2-3 hours (depending on the skills) everyone can build a real small synthesizer and customise it according to the schematics. Usually we have done this workshop like this that synth builders can get on the stage and play their instruments that they have made in the workshop together. Please check the links above.<br

/>Workshop title: Class Wargames plays Guy Debord's The Game of War<br
/>Workshop description: Ludic subversion in the bureaucratic society of controlled consumption<br
/><br
/>Class Wargames proposes hosting a 2h collective playing of Guy Debord’s <i>The Game of War </i>using a replica of his original 1977 design for the board game.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Open to all audiences, no prior knowledge required.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Guy Debord is celebrated as the leader of the Situationist International and author of the searing critique of the media-saturated society of consumer capitalism: <i>The Society of the Spectacle. </i>What is much less well known is that after the May ’68 Revolution, Debord devoted much of the rest of his life to inventing, refining and promoting what he came to regard as his most important project: <i>The Game of War. </i>For Debord, <i>The Game of War </i>wasn’t just a game - it was a guide to how people should live their lives within Fordist society. In their book-of-the-game, Guy Debord and Alice Becker-Ho take on the roles of South and North. This illustrative contest is a marital affair: the tabletop becomes an erogenous zone where the inventor and his wife face each other in libidinous combat. In their Situationist wargame, competitive play stimulated psychological intimacy between the sexes. Winning or losing were equally pleasurable experiences. By rewarding solidarity in its play, <i>The</i> <i>Game of War</i> acts as a tool of anti-militarisation in our revolutionary struggles.&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>Optional: screening of our film <i>Class Wargames plays Guy Debord's The Game of War</i> (30 min) prior to the collective playing.<br
