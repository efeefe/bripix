/>Bricolabs (<a href="http://bricolabs.net)">http://bricolabs.net)</a> is an open network with members distributed worldwide. It is home for a number of innovative ideas and practices resulting from the free/open sharing of knowledge and information with special attention to affection as a common value. Following the call to reflect upon the theme Facing North/Facing South, Bricolabs is currently organising part of the Pixelache Helsinki 2013 programme, planned and developed in a collaborative fashion. Bricolabs wants to bring a multi-layered perspective to translocal networking, engaging the participants of Pixelache 2013 into new ways of being and doing things together.<br
/>For Pixelache 2013, Bricolabs are organising discussions and panels that propose a critical perspective to the usual north/south dicothomy, portraying collaborative efforts in which the simple direction of information flows is not only hard to describe but mostly useless. In these deep resonant networking modes of interacting and constructing things, ideas and relationships, borders are seldom taken into account. This is as true for geographic borders as it is for disciplinary ones - recently Bricolabs members have turned their attention to anti-disciplinary collaboration as an escape to the common traps of western/northern paths of development.<br
/>Also part of the Bricolabs programme for Pixelache 2013 are live remote sessions with groups of people in different parts of the world and an exhibition articulating issues of open source culture, translocality, DIWO, subjective infrastructures and inversion of poles, as well as practical workshops. The festival will also give Bricolabs members a rare opportunity to meet and organise working sessions for particular collaborative projects.&nbsp;<br
