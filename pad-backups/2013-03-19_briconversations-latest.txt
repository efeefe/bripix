THE CALL

Subject: The BricoReader wants You and You :: I and I

Dear Bricoleurs! 

In  preparation for the upcoming projects and the BricoReader that we are   planning for Pixelache in Helsinki in May, we are asking that folks  within the  Bricolabs sphere of action generate some special  conversations with each other.  We believe the relevant knowledge-base  available here among us is of great value  to share (more) widely. 

The  conversations, dialogues, and/or interviews that you generate may  include  anything that you think is relevant: for example, what issues  you think define  the Pixelache theme Facing North/Facing South; what is  (your) theoretical  approach to open infrastructures and open  communities; what is your practice to  bring this theory to life; and so  on. These textual conversations may not  necessarily form an essay, but  will provide us with an array of rich material to  assemble the  BricoReader from. These dialogues may also include material  relating to  what you find most interesting/powerful/engaging about the  distributed  bricolabs network, how it functions, and how it affects participants   and the wider communities that it serves around the globe. We are also  playing  with a few sub-themes for the Brico-Pixelache presence: deep  resonant networks;  anti-disciplinary collaboration; subjective  infrastructures - autonomy vs.  connectivity; the reversal of  polarities; and the smell of Bricolabs. These  phrases might give you  some things to think and talk about as well. 

To  participate in this process, we would like you to start by considering  who  you would like to start a conversation with. We would encourage  every Bricoleur  to participate and especially to perhaps reach out to  an unfamiliar Brico on the  mailing list -- imagine the power of such a  set of dialogues that will then be  collected and bricolaged into the  BricoReader! Once you've got a dialogue  partner, please send us yours  & their names so that we might begin planning and  mapping out where  we can go with the Reader. At this point, there are 182 (!!!)  people  on the mailing list: plenty of energizing possibilities. If you are not   aware of all the people on the list, it is also possible to go to: 

http://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/brico

and  after logging in at the bottom of that page you can see see a full list  of  subscribers (by email address). If you need help on this let us  know. 

We will also list partners on this piratepad (you can add your name(s) yourself  as well): 

http://piratepad.net/briconversations

In  addition, if any of you can think of other interesting individuals or  groups  to engage with but who are not on the mailing list please feel  free to invite  them into the conversation. 

The   conversations can be initiated immediately, and certainly may be  conducted  in any way you like -- of course a text output suits us best.  We see these as  email or perhaps other text-chat transcripts,  whatever. 

To  help the editing process (and the busy editors!) along we propose a  formal  deadline of 21 March 2013 to give us time to review and collate  things. We are  looking forward to your energized expressions!

(fredd writing here) (Fredd -- what about identifying another brico to have a conversation about what you are doing there in the transformatorio residency program? -- it sounds really interesting! (I wish I would be in Europe then to propose something for it!) 
Sorry what do you mean by "identifying"? 
you can choose another brico member to have a conversation with or invite someone else outside the mailing list; --so, including another brico (who you perhaps so not know) in a conversation about what you propose here...
