 * Panel: Affective geopolitics

when we did that at the tecnomagias convergence in brasil last year the  room became quite a frenetic little lab of communications (proposal for title for remote session)
and people were even self organising into different nodes and  translators all on the same forum...was a little crazy but good fun and  lots of really active discussion ensued

* Discussion / Panel / Gathering on Open development with Bricolabbers, one person from Foreign Affairs ministry, from Kepa (organisation that supports developmental associations in FInland), Amrit Naresh (Rog), moderated by Armin Medosh.

Other ideas
 * Start every panel with a video sent from a different part of the world, reinforcing the deep resonant networking perspective on north/south divide - 

Who's working on the conf (add your names below)?

 * efeefe thinks it's too endogenous until now -- within the brico-verse or just the active people in the group, or in the wider cosmos?
 * John Hopkins (say as a pro-active participant, but perhaps not leading a panel...)
