Proposal by Victoria Sinclair

Telepresence activities during Pixelache on 17th May

Streamed panel discussion from Helsinki to be observed by festival participants, Bricolabs members and other interested network culture experts and hub co-ordinators.  The main objective is for a Brico discussion which looks at our methodology and work beyond a North-South dichotomy.    

From the IRC meeting, 13/03/13:

(18:17:47) vx: but what is productive is that simply a little skype wave - so, rob would say, you can see the whites of people's eyes.....really helps......these ongoing telepresence activities even when they have been quite rubbish have really assisted the birth of some great knowledge sharing and future partnerships
(18:18:16) jerneja: just to know the focus a little bit and present it before hand, we could get also animation from the audience, anyone could join in with their mobile/comps
(18:19:25) vx: when we did that at the tecnomagias convergence in brasil last year the room became quite a frenetic little lab of communications

Format
 * Streamed discussion by bricos in Helsinki early afternoon 17th May looking at our low tech projects and inventions to demystify conceptualisations of a dualism between North and South. Proposed length of time 90 minutes. This will be viewed by potential participants in the IRC to contextualise and give structure to the IRC (efeefe suggests the 'streamed discussion' should be one of the panels planned in http://piratepad.net/bripixconf ).
 * IRC chatroom following panel and break (another example of our low tech knowledge-sharing and problem solving to invite further discussion on points raised in the Panel. (Proposed length of time 2 hours). There are a number of experts in p2p knowledge sharing from countries such as Australia and Mexico who are keen to get a deeper inkling of the Brico aroma and this will provide them with a networking possibility as well as enhancing a discussion by Pixelache participants and those members of the         network who arent in Helsinki (efeefe asks: how will this be presented to people in the audience in Helsinki? can become a little boring...) Vicky responds that the least boring approach is probably to try to incite the audience to actually be participants.....and to have a large screen showing the irc/whatever format we decide upon.     This has worked reasonably well on other occasionals eg at the tecnomagias convergence in Brasil, May 2012 (efeefe says: in HEL, we will likely be in an auditorium for ~100 people. another option would be heading to another place, an youth center 5 minutes away from there with smaller rooms - but would it make sense to split the audience into groups or is it weird?)
 * Vicky says - there is also the possibility of doing a discussion linked to projects who work with young people.     some projects in Brasil and UK interested in participating, but would have to think seriously about logistics

Tasks for Vicky
 * Liaise with and invite participation  Brico members and other hubs
 * Finalise topics for discussion between participants
 * Test stream with Felipe (probably 16th May – note Vicky in different timezone)
 * Decide on platform for streaming on 17th May and send out URL
 * Co-ordinate and facilitate IRC chatroom        
 * create a log which can be added to a future Brico reader
