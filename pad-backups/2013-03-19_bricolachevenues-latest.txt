Dear Felipe,

I have listed here some information  about the different possibilities regarding organizing the exhibition  for Pixelache. Pictures of the different exhibition venues that can be  found on Nathalie's Flickr at

Here are the different options for the exhibition venue at the moment:

Options in Suvilahti

Suvilahti  is an old power plant area in the industrial district of Sörnäinen in  Helsinki, where a lot of cultural and performing arts organizations and  artists have their work studios. This is also where Pixelache offices  are located and where we plan to hopefully have most of the festival  programme (presentations, talks, workshops) in. 

I have attached some images of Suvilahti in this mail, more information and images can also be found here
http://www.suvilahti.fi/front-page/

* There is a space that is currently empty on the ground floor of a building called Puhdistamo (one  of the yellow buildings, the one next to the taller, circular yellow  building). As you can see from the Flickr images of the space, it is  quite big and a lot could be done with this space, for example with  movable walls. We will have a meeting about this space with the people  who manage it next week to find out what can be done in the space, if  there are any restrictions about hanging works on the walls etc and get  the exact measurements of the space.not an option anymore, according to Nathalie
  
* Another space that is available and is located next to Puhdistamo, is called Autotalli ('the  garage'), at the moment is used as storage space. It's smaller and a  very rough space and would need some walls to be built to hang things.
 
*Another option would be a rented exhibition container placed outdoors in Suvilahti.
These are the ones that we have been looking at:

We  have a permission to use the area surrounding the buildings in  Suvilahti for this purpose (the large asphalt area seen in the images of  Suvilahti)

*The Estonian Institute gallery space (pictures  labeled Viron instiuutti in the Flickr photostream)  that is also  located in Suvilahti. This space is about 100 m2, well lit and all works  must be hung from the ceiling. If we were to organize the exhibition at  the Estonian Institute, the exhibition would have to have a link with  Estonia. 

And finally, a not so ideal exhibition space, because of its location outside of Suvilahti-Sörnäinen area :

Sorbus
A  brand new gallery in the Kallio district in Helsinki. The gallery just  opened last weekend, we are at the moment finding more about the space  and its availability in May.
Some information can be found on their website at http://sorbusgalleria.tumblr.com/

I  hope this information helps in your planning of the exhibition, I will  update you soon on the different venues and any new ideas we might come  up with. Meanwhile, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have  about the different options I have listed here!


Kind regards,
Ulla
