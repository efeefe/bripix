My proposal at this point is for us to wait and see what the people from Bricolabs that will be on site during Pixelache decide to do insofar as streams, please inform day, time, duration, format and according to this we will decide if we can do something or not....My proposal would&nbsp; not be to do a conference type thing but show something that is being done (like a water ritual or making a house or an oven, dont know yet depends on what will need to be done that day)&nbsp; + perhaps an open irc to chat with people in Pixelache and answer questions if necessary + it would be good if we could have a video of something being done in Finland at the same time!!!</li

(how do we facilitate this -- send out a list of subscribers and encourage contacts, or ??) Have pairs collate the back-and-forth for us, and then have a final 'cleaning up' editorial session...

/><br
/><b>List here your view on the theme Facing North/ Facing South</b><br
/>The logic of north-south references,within geographical terms, tends to suggests a geopolitical understanding of space. It is such relation, attributed to a each specific observant that defines where north and south is. When we allow ourselves to seek a horizon line within the universe, where actually most of our the telecommunication infrastructure is navigating – to accept the freedom to circulate around these geographical references - we actually perform their disappearance.&nbsp; Within the bricolabs network, observing from various constellations, each observant perceives and performs subjectively within its own horizon, where left and right disappears and so does north and south.--&gt; Becoming a text here: <a href="http://piratepad.net/bricolachetext">http://piratepad.net/bricolachetext</a><br
/><br
/><br
/><b>INFO SENT by Nathalie to efeefe in December:</b><br
/><br
/><b>1/ Programme content &amp; formats</b><br
/><br
/>The overall theme of next year's festival being 'Facing North - Facing&nbsp; South', it will be important to discuss how the Bricolabs proposal will&nbsp; address this issue.<br
/>As global network with nodes both in the North and the South, there is certainly substance for this topic!<br
/><br
/>Another important aspect will be to<i> connect to the local community</i> here&nbsp; and in Tallinn. And that is something Pixelache can certainly help with.<br
/><br
/>In Tallinn, the programme will mostly consist of informal Camp&nbsp; Pixelache. For this we are planning to invite a keynote speaker (around&nbsp; main theme) and some plenary speakers (around sub-themes) and the rest&nbsp; is basically based on an unconference format, with an open call for&nbsp; presentations and possibly demos / workshops. Keynote and plenary&nbsp; speakers will be confirmed in the coming weeks. They have been chosen&nbsp; through a doodle poll that was open for the past month. You were one the&nbsp; candidates actually :) See here: <a href="http://www.doodle.com/hirku6e4wccudugh">http://www.doodle.com/hirku6e4wccudugh</a><br
/><br
/>A few sub-themes will help structure Camp Pixelache, that are being developed round the year through our Pixelversity programme:<br
/><a href="http://www.pixelache.ac/helsinki/pixelversity/programme-2013/">http://www.pixelache.ac/helsinki/pixelversity/programme-2013/</a><br
/><br
/>Since 'Waste/d' will definitely be a sub-theme, we actually would like&nbsp; to ask you, if you would be interested to be a plenary speaker and theme&nbsp; facilitator for Camp Pixelache?<br
/><br
/>So because we are planning a very informal programme in Tallinn, we are&nbsp; more expecting that the Bricolabs programme be for the Helsinki part,&nbsp; and perhaps the boat part, even though Bricolabs is also more than&nbsp; welcome to contribute to the Camp part. But for Helsinki, we have from&nbsp; the beginning been imagining some exhibition and seminar (but of course&nbsp; these can be done in many ways) and some workshops too.<br
/><br
/>In terms of workshop, there is already one that is planned (and it has&nbsp; its own budget) in collaboration with Usinettes (FR) and Enda &amp; Kër&nbsp; Thiossane (Senegal) around the fabrication of a plastic recycling&nbsp; machine and 3d printing with recycled plastic thread.<br
/><br
/><b>2/ The budget we can allocate to the programme bricolabs will be planning is 15000e.</b><br
/><br
/>The follow things need to be covered with this budget:<br
/>* travel &amp; accommodation costs and fees of programme planners, artists, speakers and other guests.<br
/>* possible rent of spaces (exhibition space, seminar space - but that&nbsp; depends some we can get for free), specific equipment rental (we also&nbsp; have some things, depends on what's needed), transportation of&nbsp; artworks/installations.<br
/><br
/>Pixelache provides from its own general budget / resources:<br
/>* production assistance (myself + Ulla Jaakkola)<br
/>* information &amp; communication resources (also printed matters like festival leaflet)<br
/>* some equipment that we have<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>3/ Communication between Bricolabs &amp; Pixelache</b><br
/><br
/>We understood that the planning of all this will happen through the&nbsp; bricolabs mailing list, which is an interesting experiment! It's&nbsp; important though to identify who is the main contact.<br
/>We presume you will be our main contact as you're the one who sent out the proposal?<br
/><br
/>Only Andrew Paterson from Pixelache is on the bricolabs list so far, more are planning to join to take part in the discussion. I am not sure if any other Pixelache members signed up yet.. I can ask next week when we have meeting 29.1. -Andrew<br
/><br
/>We figured that Tapio Mäkelä is a member of Bricolabs, so we might want&nbsp; to involve him a Helsinki node. Tapio has been involved in Pixelache&nbsp; earlier too!<br
/><br
/>I've taught a 1-week workshop at Pixelache in 2007, and do know Helsinki/Finland well, so maybe I can share some of that knowledge for folks going there... (who wrote that?)<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>5/ the Schedule</b><br
/><br
/>The festival is planned to take place on 16-19.5 in both Helsinki (16-17) and Tallinn (18-19)<br
/>Earlier during the festival week on 15.5, a Pixelversity online&nbsp; conference will be organised around the theme 'Knowledge &amp;&nbsp; Experience Sharing' - That might also be of interest to you!<br
/><br
/>Because some people will be coming from far away countries up to the&nbsp; North and need visas and so on, it would be good to have an idea of who&nbsp; will be the Bricolabs guests by January 15.<br
/>Let's discuss together the rest of the schedule when we skype.<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>6/ Festival venues</b><br
/><br
/>For the Helsinki part, we are planning to concentrate the events in an&nbsp; area called Suvilahti, where our office actually just moved 2 months&nbsp; ago.<br
/>Here you can see an aerial picture of the area (the part on the right of the pic)<br
/><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Suvilahti_plant_from_air.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Suvilahti_plant_from_air.jpg</a><br
/><br
/>I am also attaching another picture.<br
/><br
/>It's an old industrial area, from where it's rather quick to get to the city centre (with the metro 10min)<br
/>We are still figuring out different options for venues but here are a few details:<br
/><br
/>In the big outdoor open area, we could use exhibition containers (we have earlier used sponsored containers)<br
/>We also have a seminar/exhibition space reserved at the Estonian&nbsp; Institute which is also there, but there the works presented should be&nbsp; related to Estonia...In that place, there are also good spaces for&nbsp; smaller discussions<br
/>We are also looking at other exhibition/workshops spaces in Suvilahti but haven't got confirmation yet<br
/><br
/>In terms of seminar / discussion spaces, there are several options that we are currently trying to confirm.<br
/><br
/>On the ferry, there will the possibility to use a conference room.<br
/><br
/>For Estonia, we are actually not sure yet whether Camp Pixelache will&nbsp; take place in Tallinn or completely outside on an island called&nbsp; Naissaari (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naissaar)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naissaar)</a><br
/><br
/><br
/><b>INFO Sent from Nathalie to efeefe in January 2013:</b><br
/><br
/>As you maybe saw from the vote in our doodle poll (<a href="http://www.doodle.com/hirku6e4wccudugh)">http://www.doodle.com/hirku6e4wccudugh)</a>, there was a broad range of interest in keynote speakers, and we decided to make 3 direct invitation mails.<br
/><br
/>To Mary Mellor, Marcin Jakubowski &amp; Achille Mbembe,<br
/>As well as start a conversation with Escher Tsai about remote presentation or raising sponsorship for him to come.<br
