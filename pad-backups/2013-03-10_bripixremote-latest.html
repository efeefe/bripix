/><br
/>Proposal by Victoria Sinclair<br
/><br
/>Telepresence activities during Pixelache on 17th May<br
/><br
/>Streamed panel discussion from Helsinki to be observed by festival participants, Bricolabs members and other interested network culture experts and hub co-ordinators.&nbsp; The main objective is for a Brico discussion which looks at our methodology and work beyond a North-South dichotomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><b>Format</b><br
/><ul><li>Streamed discussion by bricos in Helsinki early afternoon 17th May looking at our low tech projects and inventions to demystify conceptualisations of a dualism between North and South. Proposed length of time 90 minutes. This will be viewed by potential participants in the IRC to contextualise and give structure to the IRC (efeefe suggests the 'streamed discussion' should be one of the panels planned in <a href="http://piratepad.net/bripixconf">http://piratepad.net/bripixconf</a> ).</li
><li>IRC chatroom following panel and break (another example of our low tech knowledge-sharing and problem solving to invite further discussion on points raised in the Panel. (Proposed length of time 2 hours). There are a number of experts in p2p knowledge sharing from countries such as Australia and Mexico who are keen to get a deeper inkling of the Brico aroma and this will provide them with a networking possibility as well as enhancing a discussion by Pixelache participants and those members of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; network who arent in Helsinki (efeefe asks: how will this be presented to people in the audience in Helsinki? can become a little boring...)<br/><br
