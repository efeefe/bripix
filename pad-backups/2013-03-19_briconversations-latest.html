><b>THE CALL</b><br
/><br
/>Subject: The BricoReader wants You and You :: I and I<br
/><br
/>Dear Bricoleurs!&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>In&nbsp; preparation for the upcoming projects and the BricoReader that we are&nbsp;&nbsp; planning for Pixelache in Helsinki in May, we are asking that folks&nbsp; within the&nbsp; Bricolabs sphere of action generate some special&nbsp; conversations with each other.&nbsp; We believe the relevant knowledge-base&nbsp; available here among us is of great value&nbsp; to share (more) widely.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>The&nbsp; conversations, dialogues, and/or interviews that you generate may&nbsp; include&nbsp; anything that you think is relevant: for example, what issues&nbsp; you think define&nbsp; the Pixelache theme Facing North/Facing South; what is&nbsp; (your) theoretical&nbsp; approach to open infrastructures and open&nbsp; communities; what is your practice to&nbsp; bring this theory to life; and so&nbsp; on. These textual conversations may not&nbsp; necessarily form an essay, but&nbsp; will provide us with an array of rich material to&nbsp; assemble the&nbsp; BricoReader from. These dialogues may also include material&nbsp; relating to&nbsp; what you find most interesting/powerful/engaging about the&nbsp; distributed&nbsp; bricolabs network, how it functions, and how it affects participants&nbsp;&nbsp; and the wider communities that it serves around the globe. We are also&nbsp; playing&nbsp; with a few sub-themes for the Brico-Pixelache presence: deep&nbsp; resonant networks;&nbsp; anti-disciplinary collaboration; subjective&nbsp; infrastructures - autonomy vs.&nbsp; connectivity; the reversal of&nbsp; polarities; and the smell of Bricolabs. These&nbsp; phrases might give you&nbsp; some things to think and talk about as well.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>To&nbsp; participate in this process, we would like you to start by considering&nbsp; who&nbsp; you would like to start a conversation with. We would encourage&nbsp; every Bricoleur&nbsp; to participate and especially to perhaps reach out to&nbsp; an unfamiliar Brico on the&nbsp; mailing list -- imagine the power of such a&nbsp; set of dialogues that will then be&nbsp; collected and bricolaged into the&nbsp; BricoReader! Once you've got a dialogue&nbsp; partner, please send us yours&nbsp; &amp; their names so that we might begin planning and&nbsp; mapping out where&nbsp; we can go with the Reader. At this point, there are 182 (!!!)&nbsp; people&nbsp; on the mailing list: plenty of energizing possibilities. If you are not&nbsp;&nbsp; aware of all the people on the list, it is also possible to go to:&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><a href="http://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/brico">http://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/brico</a><br
/><br
/>and&nbsp; after logging in at the bottom of that page you can see see a full list&nbsp; of&nbsp; subscribers (by email address). If you need help on this let us&nbsp; know.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>We will also list partners on this piratepad (you can add your name(s) yourself&nbsp; as well):&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><a href="http://piratepad.net/briconversations">http://piratepad.net/briconversations</a><br
/><br
/>In&nbsp; addition, if any of you can think of other interesting individuals or&nbsp; groups&nbsp; to engage with but who are not on the mailing list please feel&nbsp; free to invite&nbsp; them into the conversation.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>The&nbsp;&nbsp; conversations can be initiated immediately, and certainly may be&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; in any way you like -- of course a text output suits us best.&nbsp; We see these as&nbsp; email or perhaps other text-chat transcripts,&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>To&nbsp; help the editing process (and the busy editors!) along we propose a&nbsp; formal&nbsp; deadline of 21 March 2013 to give us time to review and collate&nbsp; things. We are&nbsp; looking forward to your energized expressions!&nbsp;<br

(fredd writing here) (Fredd -- what about identifying another brico to have a conversation about what you are doing there in the transformatorio residency program? -- it sounds really interesting! (I wish I would be in Europe then to propose something for it!)&nbsp;<br
/>Sorry what do you mean by "identifying"?&nbsp;<br
/>you can choose another brico member to have a conversation with or invite someone else outside the mailing list; --so, including another brico (who you perhaps so not know) in a conversation about what you propose here...<br
